# Rewritto-ide - Build Requirements
# ====================================
# This file lists all dependencies required to build Rewritto-ide
# from source on Linux.

## Build Tools
# ------------
cmake >= 3.21
gcc/g++ >= 11.0 (with C++20 support)
make or ninja
pkg-config

## Qt6 Dependencies
# -----------------
qt6-base >= 6.2.0
qt6-tools >= 6.2.0

## Qt6 Components Required
# ------------------------
Qt6Core
Qt6Widgets
Qt6Network
Qt6Test (for building tests)

## System Libraries
# -----------------
libstdc++ (GNU Standard C++ Library)
pthread (POSIX Threads)
libdl (Dynamic Loading Library)

## Optional Dependencies (for Runtime)
# -------------------------------------
# These are auto-downloaded by the AppImage build script
arduino-cli (latest)
arduino-language-server 0.7.7
clangd-18

## Development Dependencies (for Testing)
# ----------------------------------------
CTest (comes with CMake)
Qt6 Test Framework

## Installation on Ubuntu/Debian
# ===============================
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
    cmake \
    build-essential \
    qt6-base-dev \
    qt6-tools-dev \
    qt6-webengine-dev \
    pkg-config

## Installation on Arch Linux
# ============================
sudo pacman -S qt6-base qt6-tools cmake gcc make

## Installation on Fedora
# ========================
sudo dnf install \
    qt6-qtbase \
    qt6-qttools \
    cmake \
    gcc-c++ \
    make

## Building from Source
# =====================
# If Qt6 is not available in your distribution, you can build it from source:
# https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_For_Tools_and_Technologies

## Runtime Dependencies (for running Rewritto-ide)
# ===================================================
- Qt6 Runtime (Core, Widgets, Network)
- g++ runtime library
- X11 libraries
- POSIX threads library
- Standard C++ library

## Additional Tools Used During Build
# =====================================
- curl (for downloading Arduino CLI and language server)
- tar (for extracting archives)
- gzip (for decompression)
- sed, grep, awk (for text processing)

## Platform-Specific Notes
# =========================

### Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
Qt6 packages are available in the universe repository.

### Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
May need to add PPA for Qt6:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa
sudo apt update

### Arch Linux
Qt6 packages are in the official repositories.

### openSUSE Tumbleweed
Qt6 packages are in the official repositories.

## Minimum Supported Versions
# ============================
- GCC: 11.0
- Qt6: 6.2.0
- CMake: 3.21
- Linux Kernel: 5.4 (for proper c++20 support)

## Known Issues and Workarounds
# ===============================

1. Qt6 not found error:
   - Ensure Qt6 development packages are installed
   - Set Qt6_DIR environment variable to Qt6 installation

2. Build errors on older systems:
   - Ensure GCC version is at least 11.0
   - Some C++20 features may not be available in older compilers

3. Network-related features require proper Qt6 Network module

## Testing Dependencies
# =====================
# To run the test suite:
- Qt6 Test module
- CTest (part of CMake)

## Distribution Packaging
# ========================
# For building AppImage distributions, see:
# rewritto-core/qt-native-app/packaging/appimage/build-appimage.sh
